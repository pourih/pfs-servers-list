# PFS - Proxy Finding System

`pfs_servers.txt` is a regularly updated list of tested and ranked free VLESS and Shadowsocks proxy servers.

`pfs_core.py` is the Python program that performs tests on `pfs_servers.txt` and ranks the servers inside the file accoring to their speed and stability. 

`pfs_core.py` is not yet ready to be available to the public. It has too many functionalities that we can distribute between multiple little programs, and be more modular.
