## What is PFS?

PFS (Proxy Finder System) provides a **continuously updated and meticulously tested list of free proxy servers**. If you're looking for reliable ways to access the internet, this list is designed to save you time and frustration.

Forget manually searching for and testing countless servers â€“ PFS does the heavy lifting for you!

## Key Features & Benefits:

*   **Always Fresh:** Our automated system regularly discovers, tests, and refreshes the server list, ensuring you have access to currently working options.
*   **Multi-Protocol Support:** The list includes servers supporting a variety of popular protocols (like VLESS, VMess, Shadowsocks, and Trojan), giving you flexibility.
*   **Rigorous Testing:** Each server undergoes a comprehensive testing process:
    *   **Connectivity Checks:** We ensure the server is online and responsive.
    *   **Speed Evaluation:** Servers are tested for their connection speed to give you an idea of their performance.
    *   **Access Verification:** We check if servers can successfully access common internet services.
*   **Intelligent Ranking:** Servers are scored and ranked based on their performance, stability, and connection quality. The best ones rise to the top!
*   **Geo-Location Aware:** Where possible, servers are tagged with their geographic location, helping you choose servers in specific regions.
*   **Smart De-duplication:** We work to minimize redundant entries, providing a cleaner, more diverse list.
*   **Continuous Improvement:** The system includes mechanisms to archive consistently failing servers and re-evaluate potentially good ones, ensuring the list's quality over time.
